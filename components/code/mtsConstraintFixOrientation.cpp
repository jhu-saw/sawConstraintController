/*
Adds objective term (i.e. fills in 'A' and 'b' terms) to the constained optimization problem on joint velocity x 
argmin_x: ||Ax+b||, s.t. Cx>d, Ex=f

Penalizes joint velocities that will not:
Keep a given frame on the kinematic chain aligned to a specified orientation. 
argmin_x: zeta * || Jw * x + invsk(R_goal*R^-1 - I) ||

zeta is a scaling factor to determine "importance" of constraint
Jw is the 'angular' jacobian at the point of interest, i.e. [angular_velocity = Jw * joint_velocity]
R is the orientation of the frame of interest relative to the base frame, R_goal is what you want this to be
invsk denotes the 'vec' operator, that does the opposite of the 'skew' operator

The frame on the kinematic chain can be specified arbitrarily by specifying the kinematics of the 
last joint that moves the frame of interest as well as any offset from that joint to the frame of interest
The target orientation is represented as a rotation from the base frame to the goal frame
